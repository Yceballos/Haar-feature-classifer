# Haar-feature-classifer
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the application of the Haar Cascade classifier for object detection.

## Overview
The notebook Haar_example.ipynb provides a step-by-step guide to using Haar Cascade classifiers with OpenCV. Haar Cascades are used for object detection in images and videos, commonly applied for face detection.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

OpenCV
numpy
matplotlib
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copiar código
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib
Notebook Content
Introduction: Overview of Haar Cascades and their applications.
Setup: Importing necessary libraries and loading the Haar Cascade XML file.
Loading and Displaying Images: Reading images using OpenCV and displaying them with matplotlib.
Object Detection: Applying the Haar Cascade classifier to detect objects (e.g., faces) in images.
Visualization: Drawing bounding boxes around detected objects and displaying the results.
Usage
To use this notebook, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Haar_example.git
Navigate to the repository directory:
bash

cd Haar_example
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copiar código
jupyter notebook Haar_example.ipynb
Results
The notebook demonstrates how to detect objects in an image using pre-trained Haar Cascades. It includes visualization of the detected objects with bounding boxes.
